# Hades Save Editor
A project to enable easy editing of Hades savegames.

Given the engine similarities, I suspect it may work for bastion and transistor too, with some minor tweaks to the save schema.

WIP. File format deserialization is working, editing, reserialization, and a meaningful ui is not yet, I'll need to work out how the checksum is calculated first.
